          <p>We believe in the ideals of fairness, opportunity, and equality of all men without regard to their race, culture, or ethnic background.  Our biggest goal is to see that all of society can realize the importance of these three ideals.
              In order to achieve this goal, we all strive to model these behaviors and present ourselves in a gentlemanly and educated fashion.</p>
