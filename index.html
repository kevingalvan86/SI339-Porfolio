          <h1>National History</h1>
          <p>Sigma Lambda Beta (ΣΛΒ) International Fraternity, (also known as Lambda-Betas or Betas) is the largest historically Latino Greek letter intercollegiate fraternity. Founded on April 4, 1986 at the University of Iowa City, Iowa. 
              The fraternity is a member of the National Association of Latino Fraternal Organizations (NALFO), the North-American Interfraternity Conference (NIC), 
              and the Fraternity Leadership Association. Historically a Latino based fraternity, Sigma Lambda Beta welcomes men of all cultures into its brotherhood.
            </p>   
          <p>We believe in the ideals of fairness, opportunity, and equality of all men without regard to their race, culture, or ethnic background.  Our biggest goal is to see that all of society can realize the importance of these three ideals.
              In order to achieve this goal, we all strive to model these behaviors and present ourselves in a gentlemanly and educated fashion.</p>

                Sigma Lambda Beta International Fraternity, Inc. was founded by 18 Men at the University of Iowa April 4th, 1986. The establishment of Sigma Lambda Beta at the University of Michigan began in the fall of 1988 while Brother Juan Valdez attended the University of Michigan Medical School’s Post-Baccalaureate of Science program. Less than two years earlier, he and 17 other men established a fraternity whose motto, “Opportunity for Wisdom, Wisdom for Culture,” had already begun shaping campus life, community outreach, and the lives of collegiate men. His goal was to share the same values of Sigma Lambda Beta Fraternity with the University of Michigan community.
              </p>
              <p>
                On February 5th, 1989, within the walls of the West Quadrangle Wedge Room, a special meeting was called and the eight founding brothers of the Zeta Chapter were inducted. Sigma Lambda Beta International Fraternity, Inc. was officially established at the University of Michigan on April 6, 1989. Brother Juan Valdez helped create one of the first few Latino organizations at the University of Michigan, and set the foundation for many to come.
              </p>

                uring the Fall of 1997, Brother Jose Luis Martinez began to see the beloved Zeta Chapter dissolve. The National Board of Sigma Lambda Beta revoked the chapter status of the Zeta Chapter, but allowed Brother Jose Luis to induct a new line into the entity. The journey of El Regreso (Kappa Line) ended on April 17, 1998, and the new members were determined to uphold the legacy of Sigma Lambda Beta at the University of Michigan.
